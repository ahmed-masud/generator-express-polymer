Submodule for yo-express-polymer with support for Polymer 1.0

# Disclaimer
I am a back-end server-side programmer, UI/UX design is something I'm only now delving in, so my design-patterns may be way off. I will work under the following principles:

  1. Keep things as simple as possible without losing flexibility and modularity

  2. Try to build templates/scaffolding that makes sense and integrates with design patterns that exist in polymer and expressjs.

## Introduction

This template provides an express middleware interwoven with Polymer 1.0 Starter Kit

 - Adds server-side routing
 - Adds user authentication and session support through Passport.js in a sub-module

Aims to provide express integration through polymer behavior.


## On express/jade
Express uses jade for templating. This is replaced
